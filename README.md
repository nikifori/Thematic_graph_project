# Thematic Graph Project based on Wikipedia links.
The Objective of this project is to create a thematic graph based on a particular and given topic(initial word), e.g. "Tennis".  
We generated the thematic graph via the [Thematic_Graph_Maker.py](https://github.com/nikifori/Thematic_graph_project/blob/main/Thematic_Graph_Maker.py).  
We obtained some of the graph statistics via the [Graph_statistic.py](https://github.com/nikifori/Thematic_graph_project/blob/main/Graph_Statistics.py).  
  
### Results  
Directed graph: **Yes**  
Total vertices: **217** 
Total edges: **2275**  
Average degree of vertices: **10.4839**  
Density of edges relative to the max number of edges that can be possibly occured in a graph with 217 vertices: **0.0485**  
Î¤riadic closure: **0.22429**  
Selfloops: **5**  
Average clustering coefficient (vertices): **0.2387**
